    <section title="Introduction">
	  <t>
	    The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) <xref target="RFC4271"/> uses TCP as
	    its transport protocol.  BGP establishes peer relationship between
      routers using a TCP session on port 179. TCP provides reliable packet
	    communication.
    </t>
    <t>
      Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4 (MP-BGP) <xref target="RFC4760"/>
      allow BGP to carry information for multiple Network Layer protocols.
      However, only a single TCP connection can reach the Established state
      with each peer <xref target="RFC4271"/>.
    </t>
    <t>
      As pointed out by <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-multisession"/>, there
      are some disadvantages of using a single BGP session:
    <list style="empty">
      <t>
        A common criticism of BGP is the fact that most malformed messages
        cause the session to be terminated.  While this behavior is necessary
        for protocol correctness, one may observe that the protocol machinery
        of a given implementation may only be defective with respect to a
        given AFI/SAFI.  Thus, it would be desirable to allow the session
        related to that family to be terminated while leaving other AFI/SAFI
        unaffected.  As BGP is commonly deployed, this is not possible.
      </t>
      <t>
        A second criticism of BGP is that it is difficult or in some cases
        impossible to manage control plane resource contention when BGP is
        used to support diverse services over a single session.  In contrast,
        if a single BGP session carries only information for a single service
        (or related set of services) it may be easier to manage such
        contention.
      </t>
    </list></t>
    <t>
      QUIC <xref target="RFC9000"/> is an UDP-based multiplexed and secure
      transport protocol. QUIC can provide low latency and encrypted transport
      with resilient connections.  <xref target="I-D.chen-idr-bgp-over-quic"/>
      specifies the procedure to use BGP over QUIC. Complementary to it, this
      document specifies a mechanism to support BGP multisessions using QUIC
      streams.
	  </t>
    <t>
      Each session operates independently. An error on one session has
      no impact on any other session.  The BGP modification proposed
      in the document is limited to the OPEN exchange, mainly
      connection collision detection.
    </t>
    <t>
      Sessions are distinguished by the Network Layer protocol(s) negotiated
      in the OPEN message.  Multiple Network Layer protocol are negotiated
      using the Multiprotocol Extensions capability <xref target="RFC4760"/>.
    </t>

       <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
        NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",

    <section title="BGP Multisessions">
      <section title="QUIC Multi-streams">
        <t>QUIC <xref target="RFC9000"/> is a UDP-based multiplexed and
          secure transport protocol.
          It provides connection-oriented and stateful interaction between
          a client and server. QUIC integrates TLS and allows the exchange
          of application data as soon as possible.</t>

        <t>In QUIC, application protocols exchange information via streams,
          and multiple streams can be multiplexed onto an underlying
          connection. Each stream is a separate unidirectional or
          bidirectional channel of "order stream of bytes".
          Each stream has flow control which limits bytes sent on a
          stream, together with flow control of the connection.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Multiple BGP Sessions Using QUIC Streams">
        <t>
          BGP over QUIC <xref target="I-D.chen-idr-bgp-over-quic"/> proposes
          different options to map streams.  This document specifies a
          complementary and backwards compatible mechanism to achieve BGP
          multisessions using QUIC streams.  A simple implementation is to
          assign one Network Layer protocol to one BGP session, but it is
          possible to group multiple Network Layer protocols in one session.
        </t>
        <t>Connection Collision Detection procedure of the BGP specification
          <xref target="RFC4271"/> needs to be modified to allow using
          AFI/SAFI to determine the session uniqueness. Each BGP session
          operates independently, which means critical conditions (such
          as malformed message) in one session won't affect others.</t>
        <t>A QUIC stream is created by sending a BGP OPEN message, and
          each stream MUST be bidirectional as described in section 2.1
          of <xref target="RFC9000"/>. The MP-BGP capability in the OPEN
          message is used to identify the session. </t>
        <t>When a session needs to be terminated for some reason, both
          directions of the bidirectional stream MUST be terminated.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="MSC" title="MultiStream Capability">
      <t>
       The MultiStream Capability (MSC) is defined to indicate that a BGP
       speaker supports multiple sessions as specified in this document.
       The capability <xref target="RFC5492"/> is defined as follows:

        <list style="empty">
          <t>Capability code (1 octet): TBD1</t>
          <t>Capability length (1 octet): 1 (TBC)</t>
          <t>Capability value (1 octet): flag field reserved.</t>
        </list></t>
        <figure title="" suppress-title="false" align="left" alt="" width="" height="">
        <artwork xml:space="preserve" name="" type="" align="left" alt="" width="" height="">
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  |   Reserved    |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

        </artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>Reserved - MUST be set to zero by sender, MUST be ignored
          by receiver.</t>
        <t>
          The MSC applies only when BGP over QUIC
          <xref target="I-D.chen-idr-bgp-over-quic"/> is used.  It MUST be
          ignored otherwise.
        </t>
        <t>
          The specification in this document is used only if both peers
          advertise the MSC during the establishment of the "initial session".
          Otherwise the processes specified in
          <xref target="I-D.chen-idr-bgp-over-quic"/> MUST be followed.  In
          particular, if a peer that advertises the MSC doesn't receive an OPEN
          message with the MSC from its peer, it SHOULD NOT terminate the
          session.
        </t>
        <t>
          Using the MSC allows peers to establish multiple BGP sessions, one
          per QUIC stream.  Each new BGP session is established using its own
          OPEN message <xref target="RFC4271"/> and MUST include the MSC.  If
          the MSC was exchanged by both peers in the "initial session" but is
          not present when establishing a new session, the session is
          terminated and the Error Subcode MUST be set to MultiStream
          Conflict (TBD2).
        </t>
        <t>
          Once a BGP session is established, it follows the procedures
          specified in <xref target="RFC4271"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="notifications" title="Error Handling">
      <t>
        OPEN message error handling is defined in section 6.2 of
        <xref target="RFC4271"/>. This document introduces the following
        OPEN Message Error subcodes:
      <list style="empty">
        <t>
          TBD2 - MultiSession Conflict - Used if the MSC was exchanged by both peers in the "initial session" but is not present when establishing
          a new session.
        </t>
        <t>
          TBD3 - Session Capability Mismatch -  Used if a BGP speaker
          terminates a session on the case where it sends an OPEN message with
          the MSC, but receives an OPEN message without it.
        </t>
        <t>
          TBD4 - Network Layer Protocol Mismatch - Used if a BGP session has
          already been established for the signaled Network Layer Protocol,
          either explicitly or as a superset.
        </t>
      </list></t>
      <t>
        <xref target="MSC"/> recommends not terminating a session when only one
        peer supports the MSC.  If such a BGP speaker does terminate the
        session, the Error Subcode MUST be set to Session Capability Mismatch
        (TBD3).
      </t>
      <t>
        Using the MSC the peers MAY set up more than one session for a specific
        Network Layer protocol, or groups of protocols.  If this functionality
        is not enabled and a BGP speaker terminates the session, the Error
        Subcode MUST be set to Network Layer Protocol Mismatch (TBD4).
      </t>
      <t>
        Any individual BGP session can be terminated as specified in
        <xref target="RFC4486"/>.  If multiple sessions are to be terminated,
        then the procedure MUST be followed for each one.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Connection and Collision">
      <t>To detect Connection Collision, base BGP protocol
        <xref target="RFC4271"/> uses only IP addresses
        as the sole consideration. BGP multisession proposed in this
        document also takes into account the AFI/SAFI carried in a
        session. A session is considered unique if the AFI/SAFI carried
        in the session is not carried in any other session.</t>
      <t>Before creating a new session, a BGP speaker should check that
        no session exists for the AFI/SAFI included in MP-BGP capability.
        If there is an existing session for any of the AFI/SAFI, a BGP
        speaker SHOULD NOT attempt to create a new session, and a local
        error may be logged.</t>
      <t>If BGP multisession is disabled or not supported on the local
        BGP speaker, and an OPEN message is received with MSC, the local
        BGP speaker will send an OPEN message without MSC.</t>
      <t>When BGP multisession is enabled, a BGP speaker MUST send OPEN
        message with MSC.</t>
      <t>Upon receiving of an OPEN message, if the local BGP speaker is
        set to run multisession but there is no session created yet,
        and the received OPEN message doesn't include MSC, the connection
        can proceed as if there is described in
        <xref target="I-D.chen-idr-bgp-over-quic"/>. If there are
        existing sessions created with MSC, then the local BGP speaker
        MUST close the session and send a NOTIFICATION as described in
        <xref target="notifications" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>If a BGP speaker receives an OPEN message and there is already
        an existing session in ESTABLISHED state for any of the AFI/SAFI,
        it MUST ignore this OPEN message and close the session. A
        NOTIFICATION as described in <xref target="notifications"/>
        SHOULD be sent.</t>
      <t>Upon receiving of an OPEN message, if there is a session in
        OpenConfirm or OpenSent state and the two sessions are for the
        same AFI/SAFI, it is considered as a session collide, the
        procedure from section 6.8 of <xref target="RFC4271"/> MUST
        be applied, except the NOTOFICATION type.</t>
      <t>Upon receiving of an OPEN message, if there is no session
        exists for any of the AFI/SAFI carried in the MP-BGP Capability,
        the session will proceed when either of the following condition
        is met:
        <list style="empty">
        <t>This is only a single AFI/SAFI in the MP-BGP Capability,
          and the local BGP speaker also has this AFI/SAFI.</t>
        <t>There are multiple AFI/SAFIs in the MP-BGP Capability, and
          they match the local configuration of a group AFI/SAFIs to be
          combined in one session.</t>
        </list></t>
      <t>If neither of the conditions is met, a NOTIFICATION SHOULD be
        sent as described in <xref target="notifications"/>.</t>

    <section title="Modifications to FSM">
      <t>This document does not modify BGP FSM except the collision
        handling procedure.

    <section title="Operational Considerations">
      <section title="Backward Compatibility">
        <t>
          A BGP Speaker that doesn't understand the MSC will simply ignore it
          <xref target="RFC5492"/> .  <xref target="MSC"/> recommends not
          terminating a session when only one peer supports the MSC.  Instead,
          the operation will continue as specified in
          <xref target="I-D.chen-idr-bgp-over-quic"/>.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Session Prioritization">
        <t>
          One of the major drawbacks of a single BGP session is that control
          plane messages for all supported Network Layer protocols use the same
          connection, which may cause resource contention.
        </t>
        <t>
          QUIC <xref target="RFC9000"/> does not provide a mechanism for
          exchanging prioritization information and it recommends that
          implementations provide ways for an application to indicate the
          relative priority of streams, in this case mapped to BGP sessions.
          If the functionality is available, an operator should prioritize BGP
          sessions (streams) that carry critical control plane information.
          The definition of this functionality and the determination of the
          importance of a BGP session are both outside the scope of this
          document.
