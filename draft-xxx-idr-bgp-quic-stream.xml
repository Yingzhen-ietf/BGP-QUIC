    <section title="Introduction">
	  <t>
	    Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) <xref target="RFC4271"/> uses TCP as its
	    transport protocol.  BGP establishes peer relationship between routers
	    using a TCP session on port 179. TCP provides reliable packet
	    communication.
    </t>
    <t>
      Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4 (MP-BGP) <xref target="RFC4760"/>
      allows BGP to carry information for multiple address families and
      sub-families.  However, only a single TCP connection can reach the
      Established state with each peer <xref target="RFC4271"/>.
    </t>
    <t>
      As pointed out by <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-multisession"/>, there
      are some disadvantages of using a single BGP session:
    <list style="empty">
      <t>
        A common criticism of BGP is the fact that most malformed messages
        cause the session to be terminated.  While this behavior is necessary
        for protocol correctness, one may observe that the protocol machinery
        of a given implementation may only be defective with respect to a
        given AFI/SAFI.  Thus, it would be desirable to allow the session
        related to that family to be terminated while leaving other AFI/SAFI
        unaffected.  As BGP is commonly deployed, this is not possible.
      </t>
      <t>
        A second criticism of BGP is that it is difficult or in some cases
        impossible to manage control plane resource contention when BGP is
        used to support diverse services over a single session.  In contrast,
        if a single BGP session carries only information for a single service
        (or related set of services) it may be easier to manage such
        contention.
      </t>
    </list></t>
    <t>
      QUIC <xref target="RFC9000"/> is a new UDP-based multiplexed and secure
      transport protocol. QUIC can provide low latency and encrypted transport
      with resilient connections.  <xref target="I-D.chen-idr-bgp-over-quic"/>
      specifies the procedure to use BGP over QUIC. Complementary to it, this
      document specifies a mechanism to support BGP multisessions using QUIC
      streams.
	  </t>
    <t>
      Each session operates independently. An error on one session has
      no impacts on any other session. Protocol modifications proposed
      in the document is limited to the OPEN exchange state, mainly
      connection collision detection.</t>
    <t>Sessions are distinguished by the single or a group of AFI/SAFI
      carried in MP-BGP Capability <xref target="RFC5492"/> in OPEN message.</t>

    <section title="BGP Multisessions">
      <section title="QUIC Multi-streams">
        <t>QUIC <xref target="RFC9000"/> is a UDP-based multiplexed and
          secure transport protocol.
          It provides connection-oriented and stateful interaction between
          a client and server. QUIC integrates TLS and allows the exchange
          of application data as soon as possible.</t>

        <t>In QUIC, application protocols exchange information via streams,
          and multiple streams can be multiplexed onto an underlying
          connection. Each stream is a separate unidirectional or
          bidirectional channel of "order stream of bytes".
          Each stream has flow control which limits bytes sent on a
          stream, together with flow control of the connection.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Multiple BGP Sessions Using QUIC Streams">
        <t>For BGP over QUIC, there are different options to map streams,
          such as proposed in <xref target="I-D.chen-idr-bgp-over-quic"/>.
          This document proposes a different mechanism to use QUIC
          streams, and it's complementary and compatible with
          <xref target="I-D.chen-idr-bgp-over-quic"/>.
        </t>
        <t>This draft proposes BGP multisessions using QUIC streams.
          (do we need to support multiple streams per session??)
          Each BGP session is for one or a group of AFI/SAFIs carried
          in one QUIC stream. Although the most natural way is to have one
          AFI/SAFI in one BGP session, it is possible to group some
          AFI/SAFIs in one session. For example, an operator may want to
          group BGP-LS SAFIs (AFI 16288, SAFI 71 and 72) together.
        </t>
        <t>Connection Collision Detection procedure of the BGP specification
          <xref target="RFC4271"/> needs to be modified to allow using
          AFI/SAFI to determine the session uniqueness. Each BGP session
          operates independently, which means critical conditions (such
          as malformed message) in one session won't affect others.</t>
        <t>A QUIC stream is created by sending a BGP OPEN message, and
          each stream MUST be bidirectional as described in section 2.1
          of <xref target="RFC9000"/>. The MP-BGP capability in the OPEN
          message is used to identify the session. </t>
        <t>When a session needs to be terminated for some reason, both
          directions of the bidirectional stream MUST be terminated.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Multisession Capability">
      <t> A new BGP capability <xref target="RFC5492"/> code, Multisession
      Capability (MSC), is added to indicate that a BGP speaker supports
      multiple sessions. If both peers have not advertised the capability,
      it cannot be used.</t>
      <t>MSC applies only when QUIC is used. It MUST be ignored
        otherwise.</t>
      <t>Using the MSC allows peers to establish multiple BGP sessions,
        one per QUIC stream. EACH BGP session sends its own OPEN message.
        The operation of BGP <xref target="RFC4271"/> remains unchanged.
      </t>
      <t>All the OPEN message exchanged MUST include the MSC. If one of
        the additional stream-based sessions doesn't include the MSC,
        then it MUST be closed with a NOTIFICTION as described in
        <xref target="notifications" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>MSC is defined as below:
        <list style="empty">
          <t>Capability code (1 octet): TBD</t>
          <t>Capability length (1 octet): TBD</t>
          <t>Capability value (1 octet): flag field reserved.</t>

        <t>Reserved - MUST be set to zero by sender, MUST be ignored

        <t>The AFI/SAFI included in this session is identified by the
          MP-BGP capability in the OPEN message.</t>
        <t>When BGP over QUIC is used, multisession is enabled
          by default, unless configured otherwise. BGP speaker MUST
          advertise Multisession Capability in the OPEN message on
          every session. When a multisession capable BGP speaker receives
          an OPEN message without MSC, it MUST assume
          the peer is not multisession capable, and fall back to single
          session BGP. A NOTIFICATION SHOULD be sent as described in
          <xref target="notifications" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>When BGP multisession is enabled, BGP speaker MUST advertise
        Multisession capability in OPEN message on every session.</t>
        <t>When BGP multisession is disabled, a BGP speaker SHOULD NOT
          send OPEN message with MSC.</t>
        <t>For a given pair of BGP peers, when BGP multisession is used,
          all sessions MUST be created using OPEN message with MSC, one
          session/stream for one or a group of AFI/SAFIs. It MUST NOT
          be combined with a session created without using MSC.</t>
        <t>After a BGP speaker receives an OPEN message with MSC and it
          validates the message and proceeds with the session, the
          original Finite State Machine applies.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="notifications" title="New NOTIFICATIONs">
     <t>A BGP NOTIFICATION message is sent when there is an error
      condition. OPEN message error handling is defined in section 6.2
      of <xref target="RFC4271"/>. This document adds the following
      subcodes to the NOTIFICATION message.
     </t>
     <t>This document introduces the following new subcodes for OPEN
      Message Error Code:
      <list style="empty">
        <t>10 - MultiSession Conflict - When there are existing
          BGP sessions created with MSC, and an OPEN message received
          without MSC. Or there is an existing BGP session established
          without MSC and an OPEN message received with MSC.
        </t>
        <t>11 - Session Capability Mismatch - When a BGP speaker sends an OPEN
          message with MSC, but received an OPEN message without MSC.
        </t>
        <t>12 - AFI/SAFI Mismatch - When there is an existing BGP session
          for an AFI/SAFI, and a new OPEN message is received to create
          a session for the AFI/SAFI, or the MP-BGP Capability in the
          OPEN message overlaps with existing sessions.
        </t>
      </list></t>
      <t>Note: The numbers used here are proposals to IANA.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Connection and Collision">
      <t>To detect Connection Collision, base BGP protocol 
        <xref target="RFC4271"/> uses only IP addresses
        as the sole consideration. BGP multisession proposed in this
        document also takes into account the AFI/SAFI carried in a
        session. A session is considered unique if the AFI/SAFI carried
        in the session is not carried in any other session.</t>
      <t>Before creating a new session, a BGP speaker should check that
        no session exists for the AFI/SAFI included in MP-BGP capability.
        If there is an existing session for any of the AFI/SAFI, a BGP
        speaker SHOULD NOT attempt to create a new session, and a local
        error may be logged.</t>
      <t>If BGP multisession is disabled or not supported on the local
        BGP speaker, and an OPEN message is received with MSC, the local
        BGP speaker will send an OPEN message without MSC.</t> 
      <t>When BGP multisession is enabled, a BGP speaker MUST send OPEN
        message with MSC.</t>
      <t>Upon receiving of an OPEN message, if the local BGP speaker is
        set to run multisession but there is no session created yet,
        and the received OPEN message doesn't include MSC, the connection
        can proceed as if there is described in
        <xref target="I-D.chen-idr-bgp-over-quic"/>. If there are
        existing sessions created with MSC, then the local BGP speaker
        MUST close the session and send a NOTIFICATION as described in
        <xref target="notifications" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>If a BGP speaker receives an OPEN message and there is already
        an existing session in ESTABLISHED state for any of the AFI/SAFI,
        it MUST ignore this OPEN message and close the session. A
        NOTIFICATION as described in <xref target="notifications"/>
        SHOULD be sent.</t>
      <t>Upon receiving of an OPEN message, if there is a session in
        OpenConfirm or OpenSent state and the two sessions are for the
        same AFI/SAFI, it is considered as a session collide, the
        procedure from section 6.8 of <xref target="RFC4271"/> MUST
        be applied, except the NOTOFICATION type.</t>
      <t>Upon receiving of an OPEN message, if there is no session
        exists for any of the AFI/SAFI carried in the MP-BGP Capability,
        the session will proceed when either of the following condition
        is met:
        <list style="empty">
        <t>This is only a single AFI/SAFI in the MP-BGP Capability,
          and the local BGP speaker also has this AFI/SAFI.</t>
        <t>There are multiple AFI/SAFIs in the MP-BGP Capability, and
          they match the local configuration of a group AFI/SAFIs to be
          combined in one session.</t>
        </list></t>
      <t>If neither of the conditions is met, a NOTIFICATION SHOULD be
        sent as described in <xref target="notifications"/>.</t>

      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Operational Considerations">
      <section title="Backford Compatibility">
        <t>For backward compatibility, it is important for multisession
        capable BGP speaker to be able to interoperate with BGP speakers
        which are not multisession capable. In such case, the BGP speaker
        should behave as described in <xref target="I-D.chen-idr-bgp-over-quic"/>
        and <xref target="RFC4271"/>.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Session Prioritization">
        <t>One of the major drawbacks of a single session BGP is that
          packets from all AFI/SAFI are sent through this single session,
          and this may cause resource contention.</t>
        <t>QUIC <xref target="RFC9000"/> does not provide a mechanism
          or exchanging prioritization information. It relies on the
          application's receiving priority information and each QUIC
          stream is flow controlled independently. QUIC suggests an
          implementation SHOULD provide ways for an application to indicate
          the relative priority of streams. BGP sessions should be created
          using different priorities. For example, AFI/SAFI that carries
          routing information SHOUD be given higher priority and generous
          flow control.</t> 
        <t>An implementation SHOULD support explicit configuration of
          session priorities.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="BGP Timers">
        <t>BGP timers are defined in section 10 of <xref target="RFC4271"/>.
        All BGP timers are maintained per session.</t>
        <t>Each stream session can use different HoldTime and KeepaliveTime.
          This can be done either through configuration or the value in
          the OPEN message. If an AFI/SAFI is not carrying critical routing
          information, slower timer may be used.</t>

      </section>
      <section title="Other Considerations">
      <t>A configuration command SHOULD be implemented to enable or
        disable multisession.</t>
      <t>A configuration command SHOULD be implemented to allow grouping
        of some AFI/SAFIs into one session.</t>
      <t>Implementations supporting multisession BGP SHOULD have show commands
        to view the state of each individual session, notifications and
        logs.</t>
      <t>It is up to the implementation to decide whether to handle
        such session in the same process or thread.</t>
