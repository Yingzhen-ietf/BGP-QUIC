    <section title="Introduction">
	  <t>
	    Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) uses TCP as its transport protocol.
      BGP establishes peer relationship between routers using a TCP session
      on port 179. TCP provides reliable packet communication.
    </t>
    <t>QUIC <xref target="RFC9000"/> is a new UDP-based multiplexed and
    secure transport protocol. QUIC can provide low latency and encrypted
    transport with resilient connections.
    </t>
    <t><xref target="I-D.chen-idr-bgp-over-quic"/> proposes BGP over QUIC
    and the corresponding procedures. Complementary to
    <xref target="I-D.chen-idr-bgp-over-quic"/>, this draft introduces a
    mechanism of supporting BGP multisessions using multiple QUIC streams. 
	  </t>

    <section title="Requirements Language">
       <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
        NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
        "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
        described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/>
        when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Motivation">
      <section title="One TCP Session">
        <t>Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4 (MP-BGP)
          <xref target="RFC4760"/> allows BGP to carry
          information for multiple address families and sub-families, 
          however it only allows a single ESTABLISHED connection with
          each peer. </t>
        <t>As pointed out by <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-multisession"/>,
        there are some disadvantages of using a single BGP session. It
        is summarized as the following:
        <list style="empty">
          <t>Most malformed messages cause BGP session to be terminated,
            and this causes all AFI/SAFIs to reset, while a malformed
            message may only impact a given AFI/SAFI. It is desirable
            to allow the impacted AFI/SAFI to be terminated or reset
            while leaving other AFI/SAFI unaffected.
          </t>
          <t>Since all AFI/SAFI packets are multiplexed into a single
            BGP session, there would be resource contention when in some
            cases. Ideally packets for routes update should be given 
            higher priorities, for example packets for IPv4 unicast
            route update should have a higher priority than packets for
            sending flow spec.
          </t>
        </list></t>

      </section>
      <section title="BGP over QUIC">
        <t><xref target="I-D.chen-idr-bgp-over-quic"/> proposes BGP 
        over QUIC. Section 4.3 describes a few options of how to map BGP
        traffic to QUIC streams in order to solve the head-of-line
        issues, but how BGP routers would interoperate with multi
        streams is not defined.</t>
        <t>This draft defines a mechanism to support BGP multisessions
          using QUIC streams.</t>
      </section>
	
    </section>

    <section title="Multi-Stream Capability">
      <t>-- Only valid for BGP over QUIC; ignore otherwise
         -- Options: control session vs complete independence
         --- Keepalives
         -- Backwards Compatibility (with draft-chen-idr-bgp-over-quic)</t>

      <section title="QUIC Multi-streams">
        <t>In QUIC, multiple streams can be multiplexed onto an underlying
          connection. Each stream is a separate "order stream of bytes".
          Each stream has flow control which limits bytes sent on a
          stream.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Multiple BGP sessions over QUIC streams">
        <t>This draft proposes to start BGP peering sessions based on
          AFI/SAFI. It's possible to set but sessions use different options
          , such as proposed in <xref target="I-D.chen-idr-bgp-over-quic"/>,
          but that's out of scope of this draft.
        </t>
        <t>Connection Collision Detection procedure of the BGP specification
          <xref target="RFC4271"/> needs to be modified to allow using
          AFI/SAFI to determine the session uniqueness. Each BGP session
          operates independently.</t>
        <t>Before creating a new session, it should be checked that
          no session exists for the AFI/SAFI peers. If there is an
          existing session for the AFI/SAFI peers, a BGP speaker SHOULD
          NOT attempt to create a new session, and a local error may be
          logged.</t>
        <t>If a BGP speaker receives an OPEN message and there is already
          an existing session for the same AFI/SAFI, it SHOULD ignore
          this OPEN message.</t>
        <t>When a BGP speaker is running multisessions, and there is an
          error, such as malformed message, in one session that requires
          the session to be terminated or reset, it SHOULD only reset
          the session impacted, not any other sessions.</t>
      </section>    
    </section>

    <section title="Use of Multiple OPEN Messages">
      <t> Each BGP session is established using its own OPEN message.
        New BGP capability <xref target="RFC5492"/> code to indicate
        that a BGP speaker supports multi sessions is defined.
        <list style="empty">
          <t>Capability code (1 octet): TBD</t>
          <t>Capability length (1 octet): variable</t>
          <t>Capability value (1 octet): flags followed by the AFI/SAFI
             of the session.</t>

        <t>When BGP multisession is enabled, BGP speaker MUST advertise
        Multisession capability in OPEN message on every session.</t>
        <t>When BGP over QUIC is used, multisession should be enabled
          by default, unless configured otherwise. BGP speaker MUST
          advertise Multisession Capability in then OPEN message on 
          every session. When a multisession capable BGP speaker receives
          an OPEN message without Mutisession Capability, it MUST assume
          the peer is not multisession capable, and fall back to single
          session BGP.</t>

    <section title="Modifications to FSM">
      <t> TBD.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Operational Considerations">
      <t>For backward compatibility, it is important for multisession
        capable BGP speaker to be able to interoperate with BGP speakers
        which are not multisession capable. There are a few possible
        scenarios listed below:
        <list style="empty">
          <t>ssss</t>
        </list></t>
      <t>A configuration command SHOULD be implemented to enable or
        disable multisession.</t>
      <t>Implementations supporting multisession BGP SHOULD have show commands
        to view the state of each individual session, notifications and
        logs.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document does not change the BGP security model.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>The document requests IANA to allocate a BGP Capability Code
        as BGP QUIC Multisession Capability. </t>
